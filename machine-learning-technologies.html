<h2>Introduction to machine learning technologies</h2>
<p>
Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems with the ability to learn and improve without being explicitly programmed. 
The process of learning begins with looking for patterns in observations or data to make better predictions on new observations or data coming in. 
Deep learning is the latest and widely used approach of Machine Learning. This blog should clarify some of the terminologies used in Machine Learning.
</p>
<br/>
<h4>Explicit Programming Vs Machine Learning</h4> 
<p>Explicit programming refers to the process of coming up with steps (called algorithm) to solve the problem. 
Calculating the sum of two numbers or to sort numbers are examples of explicit programming. 
Distinguishing human from the background is a complex problem and can be achieved by both explicit programming and deep learning. 
Using explicit programming one can come up with steps where the pixels that are stationary are considered to be part of the background,
while the changing pixels are classified as the one belonging to the moving human body. 
This is known as <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.10020.pdf" target="_blank">background subtraction</a> and is algorithmic.
</p>
<p>
Deep learning has a very different approach. Since it is complimentary to explicit programming, the deep learning platforms are not interested in knowing or understanding details of your problem.
Instead deep learning requires a set of training data and expected outputs. The deep learning platform learns how input relates to output.
Given a sound whether it is of human or machine. A deep learning platform thus takes in the training data and generates a model. 
The model contains the information to classify any new input into an output in accordance with what it has learned. 
This opens up computing to a whole new set of problems that are difficult to do explicitly, eg,
finding objects in a picture, autonomous vehicles, and many more such complex problems.
<p>
Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, depending on the nature of learning the system undergoes.
</p>
	<ul>
	<li>
	<h4>Supervised learning</h4> 
	<p>
	 <em>The computer is presented with training data that consists of example inputs and their desired outputs. 
	The computer creates representations from this data in a way that it can predict what the output will be for any new data coming in.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
	  <a href="predictive-maintenane-machine-learning.html">Predicting if a battle tank requires maintenance</a> is one example of supervised learning. 
	  Where tank coming in for maintenance are checked for various conditions, 
	  the expert then decides whether the tank requires maintenance or not. This data is fed into a machine learning platform (like Tensorflow or PyTorch) to generate models.
	  These models are then used to make predictions.
     </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h4>Unsupervised learning</h4>
	<p><em>No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. 
	Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end (feature learning).
	</em> </p>
	<p>
	Unsupervised learning is about classifying data into clusters, where each cluster has some common characteristics. For example, looking at DNA patterns and
	discovering such clusters to understand evolutionary processes.
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h4>Reinforcement learning</h4>
	<p><em> A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent). 
	As it navigates its problem space, the program is provided feedback that's analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximize.
	</em><p>
	<p>
	Reinforcement learning rewards the model if it behaves in a certain way in a certain environment. 
	This way the model is trained to perform in certain way to maximize the rewards. Such methodologies are used in training autonomous driving,
	where the system learns complex policies in a high dimensional environment.
	</p>
	</li>
	</ul>
  <p>
  All of the above machine learning techniques can be implemented using deep learning. 
    <br/>
    <br/>
  <h4>Deep learning</h4>
  <p>
  Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that mimics the working of the human mind. 
  A unit in a deep learning network mimics a neuron. A <em>neuron</em> is a mathematical function that model the functioning of a biological neuron. 
  Typically, a neuron computes the weighted average of its input, and this sum is passed through a nonlinear function, called an activation function.
  A network of such neurons arranged in layers can learn relationships between the features that other algorithms cannot easily discover
  A deep learning network is arranged in layers such that output of one layer is fed as input to another layer.
  The interesting fact is that the deep learning network need not know what features are there in the data before-hand.
  It discovers these features in the data and their contribution to the desired output just based on of how a neuron works.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <img class="img-fluid feature" src="img/artificial-neural-network-model.png" atl="A deep learning network of neurons">
  <h6> Figure: The above figure shows neurons arranged in layers. The inner layers are usually referred to as hidden layers.</h6>
  <br/><br/><br/>
  <h5>Statistical fit</h5>
  <p>
  The deep learning tools/platforms are statistically trying to approximate the unknown mapping functions that connect your input data to output. 
  If you have a small amount of data sometimes the model that you get is over-fitted. <b>Overfitting</b> means that the platform has literally learned the mapping such that 
  it has also learned noises in the data with all the details. 
  Such a model is not good as it will give perfect predictions if the data is a repeat of what was used in training, but will give wild predictions if it sees new data. 
  To get over an overfitted model ideally you should come up with a network that has a similar capacity as the amount of data that you will be using for training.
  Best is to get good a amount of training data in order to avoid an overfitted model.
  </p>
  <p>
  On the other end if your training data is not very good you may get an under-fitted model. An <b>Underfitted</b> model is unable to get the underlying mapping between input and output right.
  To get over an underfitted model you need to have a good quality of training data that has sufficient information for the deep learning platform to extract the relationship between input and output.
  </p>
  <p>
  Usually when you train a model you do it with 80% of that the data that you have. You label this data as a training set. The rest 20% is used to test the model. With the test data you can figure out
  if you have an overfitted or underfitted model. A good fit model will give you reasonable results with the test data.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <h5>Loss function</h5>
  <p>
  As we have noticed that the deep learning platform during training phase leans towards features in that data that have effect on the output. In order to do that it uses a loss function. A <em>loss function</em>
  is used to output error. Why do we need a loss function? Why don't we just output the difference between the predicted result and result contained in the training data? Hey, yes there is a loss function that
  just outputs this difference. It is possible that for most of the scenarios a simple loss function is good enough. In some situation where you are looking for yes/no kind of answers the simple kind of
  loss function may not work, so you move to slightly complex functions, say a logarithmic function that that blows up on error. This could help the model to converge quickly to a statistically right fitted model.
  For generic problems like object detection using CNN, there are some functions that were found to give good results like 
  <a href=https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/5-regression-loss-functions-all-machine-learners-should-know-4fb140e9d4b0" target="_blank">mean squared error</a> or 
  <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/cross-entropy-for-machine-learning/" target="_blank">cross-entropy loss</a>, thus they are widely used.
  </p> 
  <br/>
  <h5>Activation function</h5>
  <p>
  In a deep learning neural network, the training process enforces features that closely relate to the given output. How a neuron does that? 
  A neuron uses a <a href="https://www.analyticssteps.com/blogs/7-types-activation-functions-neural-network" target="_blank">activation function</a> along with assigned weights to generate output.
   An <em>activation function</em> is responsible for transforming the summed weighted input from the node into the activation of the node or output for that input. Like the chosen loss function can
   affect if the model will converge to good fit quickly or not, in the same way choosing activation function can affect the quality of the final model.
